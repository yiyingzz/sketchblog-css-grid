## known issues

- seems to breakdown on mobile (at least on my phone which is admittedly pretty old) 
- I used smaller row heights than the tutorial (2px) which creates a ton of rows so that might cause a problem when there's too many
- images might be loading in at different times (not sure if this would make a difference?)
- my images are pretty big --> maybe try `srcset`
